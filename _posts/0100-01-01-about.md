# About

The content for this website has been drawn from the [IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology report (v1.01)](https://iucnrle.org/static/media/uploads/references/research-development/keith_etal_iucnglobalecosystemtypology_v1.01.pdf).

**We are currently working on a major update to version 2.0**, which includes new functional groups and improvements to the profiles.

We are also working on adapting the maps from the original reports to optimize navigation on the web. **Expect frequent updates.**

*Earth’s ecosystems: a function-based typology for conservation and sustainable management*

(**in preparation**)

# Development of the typology

This typology was developed over more than two years, with an extensive development and review process initiated and co-ordinated by the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management. The initial structure of the typology was developed at a forum attended by 48 specialists in marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems at Kings College London in May 2017, funded by the [PLuS Alliance](https://plusalliance.org/). Lead contributors then drafted descriptive profiles for each Ecosystem Functional Group, in consultation with other experts. Review of the definition and arrangement of units within the typological hierarchy was co-ordinated by the lead author (Keith) through the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management.

This consultation and review process was an extensive community effort, with "ecosystem leaders" engaged for all realms and biomes in the world, representing the collective views of global research networks, numbering hundreds of people. In all, some 30 specialists formally reviewed 1-14 ecosystem functional types each, with less formal comment and input received through a much larger group of experts at international conferences, workshops and meetings during 2017- 2019. Workshops arranged by IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management and international conference symposia (20-100 participants) formed part of a broad consultation process,  held at the following locations and dates:

* London, UK May 2017– IUCN workshop/meeting
* Cartagena, Colombia July 2017 – IUCN workshop/meeting
* Cartagena, Colombia July 2017 – [ICCB symposium](https://conbio.org/images/content_conferences/ICCB2017_Abstract_Book_web_w_doi.pdf)
* Naypyidaw, Myanmar, Sept 2017 – IUCN workshop/meeting
* Newcastle, Australia, November 2017 – ESA symposium
* Canberra, Australia, May 2018 – Boden conference
* Davos Switzerland, June 2018 – Polar2018 symposium
* Gland Switzerland June 2018 – IUCN workshop/meeting
* Amman, Jordan, Sept 2018 – IUCN workshop/meeting
* Dubai, UAE, Oct 2018 – Eye ON Earth symposium
* Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia July 2019 – ICCB symposium
* Maputo, Mozambique, Mar 2019 – IUCN workshop/meeting
* Mombasa, Kenya Mar 2019 – IUCN workshop/meeting
* New York, USA, June 2019 – [UN SEEA-EEA forum of experts](https://seea.un.org/events/2019-forum-experts-seea-experimental-ecosystem-accounting)
* Jurmala, Latvia, Sept 2019 – IUCN workshop/meeting
* Helsinki, Finland, Oct 2019 – IUCN workshop/meeting
* Sydney, Australia, Nov 2019 – [Ocean Ecosystems Accounting symposium](https://www.unescap.org/events/global-dialogue-ocean-accounting-and-first-annual-meeting-global-ocean-accounts-partnership)

The process outlined above involved up to five iterations of review and revision for each descriptive ecosystem functional type, and sometimes involved significant addition of content, revision of group definitions or recognition of additional groups. Every ecosystem functional group was finally reviewed and edited for conceptual consistency by Keith, and subject to a final production edit.
