# The new *IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology*

The **IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology** comprises six hierarchical levels, with the three upper levels developed on this website allowing navigation from global to local scales. The three upper levels, realms, functional biomes and ecosystem functional groups, classify ecosystems based on their functional characteristics (such as water regime or temperature), irrespective of what organisms live in them. The three lower levels of classification, biogeographic ecotype, global ecosystem type and subglobal ecosystem type (see this <a href='https://iucnrle.org/static/media/uploads/references/research-development/keith_etal_iucnglobalecosystemtypology_v1.01.pdf' target='_blank'>technical report</a> for more information) are often already in use and incorporated into policy infrastructure at national levels and can be linked to these upper levels. This is crucial, as important conservation action occurs at local levels, where most expertise resides.

## Level 1: Realm

One of five major components of the biosphere that differ fundamentally in ecosystem organisation and function: terrestrial, freshwater, marine, subterranean, atmospheric.

## Level 2: Biomes
A component of a realm united by one or a few common major ecological drivers that regulate major ecological functions, derived from the top-down by subdivision of realms (level 1).

## Level 3: Ecosystem Functional Groups

A group of related ecosystems within a biome that share common ecological drivers promoting convergence of biotic traits that characterise the group. Derived from the top-down by subdivision of biomes.
