title: F2.10 Subglacial lakes

These hidden lakes exist beneath permanent ice sheets, sometimes tens to thousands of metres below, mostly in Antarctica and Greenland. Bacteria and other microbes are the only forms of life, but there is a surprising diversity of them. Productivity is very low in the dark and freezing conditions, with species relying on metabolism of chemicals such as methane, iron and sulphur to support the simple foodweb.

# Ecological Traits
 
Remarkable lacustrine ecosystems occur beneath permanent ice sheets. They are placed within the Lakes biome ([F2](/explore/biomes/F2)) due to their relationships with some Freeze-thaw lakes ([F2.4](/explore/groups/F2.4)), but they share several key features with the Subterranean freshwater biome ([SF1](/explore/biomes/SF1)). Evidence of their existence first emerged in 1973 from airborne radar-echo sounding imagery, which penetrates the ice cover and shows lakes as uniformly flat structures with high basal reflectivity. The biota of these ecosystems is very poorly known due to technological limitations on access and concerns about the risk of contamination from coring. Only a few shallow lakes up to 1 km beneath ice have been surveyed (e.g. Lake Whillams in West Antarctica and Grímsvötn Lake in Iceland). The exclusively microbial trophic web is truncated, with no photoautotrophs and apparently few multi-cellular predators, but taxonomic diversity is high across bacteria and archaea, with some eukaryotes also represented. Chemosynthesis form the base of the trophic web, chemolithoautotrophic species using reduced N, Fe and S and methane in energy-generating metabolic pathways. The abundance of micro-organisms is comparable to that in groundwater ([SF1.2](/explore/groups/SF1.2)) (10<sup>4</sup> – 10<sup>5</sup> cells.ml<sup>-1</sup>), with diverse morphotypes represented including long and short filaments, thin and thick rods, spirals, vibrio, cocci and diplococci. Subglacial lakes share several biotic traits with extremophiles within ice ([T6.1](/explore/groups/T6.1)), subterranean waters ([SF1.1](/explore/groups/SF1.1), [SF1.2](/explore/groups/SF1.2)) and deep oceans (e.g. [M2.3](/explore/groups/M2.3), [M2.4](/explore/groups/M2.4), [M3.3](/explore/groups/M3.3)), including very low productivity, slow growth rates, large cell sizes and aphotic energy synthesis. Although microbes of the few surveyed subglacial lakes, and from accreted ice which has refrozen from lake water, have DNA profiles similar to those of other contemporary microbes, the biota in deeper disconnected lake waters and associated lake-floor sediments, could be highly relictual if it evolved in stable isolation over millions of years under extreme selection pressures.

# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Subglacial lakes vary in size from less than 1 km<sup>2</sup> to ~10,000 km<sup>2</sup>, and most are 10-20 m deep, but Lake Vostok (Antarctica) is at least 1,000 m deep. The environment is characterised by high isostatic pressure (up to ~350 atmospheres), constant cold temperatures marginally below 0°C, low-nutrient levels, and an absence of sunlight. Oxygen concentrations can be high due to equilibration with gas hydrates from the melting ice sheet base ice, but declines with depth in amictic lakes due to limited mixing, depending on convection gradients generated by cold meltwater from the ice ceiling and geothermal heating from below. Chemical weathering of basal debris is the main source of nutrients supplemented by ice melt.
 
# Distribution
 
Some ~400 subglacial lakes in Antarctica, ~60 in Greenland and a few in Iceland and Canada have been identified from radar remote sensing and modelling. 

Major occurrences of subglacial lakes were mapped as point records from Wright and Siegert (2012), Bowler _et al._ (2019), Marteinsson _et al._ (2013) and Livingstone _et al._ (2016). Unmapped lakes are likely to occur within areas with permanent snow and ice cover and were mapped as minor occurrences based on permanent snow and ice from Dinerstein _et al._ (2017) and Tuanmu _et al._ (2014).
