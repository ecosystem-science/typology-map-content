SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 
These grassy woodlands and grasslands are dominated by C4 stoloniferous, rhizomatous and tussock grasses that are kept short by vertebrate grazers. Trophic savannas, relative to pyric savannas ([T4.2](/explore/groups/T4.2)), have unique plant and animal diversity within a complex trophic structure dominated by abundant mammalian herbivores and predators. These animals are functionally differentiated in body size, mouth morphology, diet and behaviour. They promote fine-scale vegetation heterogeneity and dominance of short grass species, sustaining the system through positive feedbacks and limiting fire fuels. Trees and grasses possess functional traits that promote tolerance of chronic herbivory, as well as seasonal drought. Seasonally high productivity coincides with summer rains. The dry season induces grass curing and leaf fall in deciduous and semi-deciduous woody plants. Trees are shade-intolerant during establishment. and most develop chemical (e.g. phenolics) or physical (e.g. spinescence) herbivory defence traits and an ability to resprout as they enter the juvenile phase. Their soft microphyll-notophyll foliage has relatively high SLA and low C
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Trophic savannas like pyric savannas are driven by seasonal climates, but generally occupy environmental niches with lower rainfall and higher soil fertility. A high annual rainfall deficit of 400mm to more than 1800mm. Annual rainfall generally varies from 300mm to 700mm, always with strong seasonal (winter) drought, but these savanna types are restricted to landscapes with sufficient water bodies (rivers, lakes) to sustain high densities of large mammals. Temperatures are warm-hot with low-moderate variability through the year. Low intensity fires have return intervals of 5-50 years, depending on animal densities and inter-annual rainfall variation, usually after the growing season, removing much of the remaining biomass not consumed by herbivores. Soils are moderately fertile and often have a significant clay component.
 
# Distribution
 
Seasonal tropics and subtropics of Africa and Asia.
