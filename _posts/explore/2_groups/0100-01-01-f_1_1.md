title: F1.1 Permanent upland streams
version: v1.0, 2020-01-20 12:00:00

These are small rivers or streams in mountainous or hilly areas, with steep gradients and fast flow. They flow all year, increasing in wet periods, in humid tropical and temperate zones. Stones are common along their rapids and pools, turning over and oxygenating the water. Dependent organisms are specialised for these high flow-velocity environments, receiving resources for food webs from the river and adjacent and upstream vegetation.

# Ecological Traits
 
These riverine systems generally have low productivity and a relatively simple trophic structure, low species’ diversity but high endemism due to aquatic insularity. Many systems are highly dendritic, leading to species and generic differentiation even in nearby but separated streams. In temperate regions, there is often overhead tree canopy, with copious leaf fall, providing significant allochthonous subsidies to in situ primary production by phytoplankton and periphyton. Microbes and invertebrate shredders and detritivores break down leaf fall and other organic matter . Riparian zones may include large trees and other vegetation, drawing surface and groundwater from the upland river and reducing direct sunlight. Many organisms are specialised to live in high flow velocity environments. Biofilms of micro-organisms establish on rocks and process organic matter. Invertebrate functional groups include shredders, grazers, collectors, filter feeders and ambush predators. Filter feeders have traits adapted to turbulence, allowing them to hold fast to substrates while capturing resources. Fish have small body sizes. Birds with specialised foraging behaviours (<i>e.g.</i> dippers, kingfishers) are common in upland streams.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
These streams have flow regimes with high velocity and relatively low but reliable perennial volume. They flow down moderate to steep slopes causing considerable erosion and sediment transport. These factors drive nutrient and organic matter transport downstream induce turbulence, and hence are highly oxygenated. Flow volume and variability depends on rainfall seasonality, snowmelt in or from cold-climate catchments, as well as catchment size.
 
# Distribution
 
In steep to moderate terrain throughout the humid tropical and temperate zones, rarely extending to boreal latitudes.

Major occurrences of permanent upland streams was estimated using a global river environmental stratification database (Ouellet Dallaire et al. 2018). Freshwater ecoregions with suitable conditions for this functional groups were identified  consulting available ecoregion descriptions (Abell et al. 2008), global and regional reviews and expertise of authors, these were marked as minor occurrences.
