These are small rivers or streams in mountainous or hilly areas, with steep gradients and fast flow. They flow all year, increasing in wet periods, in humid tropical and temperate zones. Stones are common along their rapids and pools, turning over and oxygenating the water. Dependent organisms are specialised for these high flow-velocity environments, receiving resources for food webs from the river and adjacent and upstream vegetation.

# Ecological Traits

These 1st-3rd order streams generally have steep gradients, fast flows, coarse substrates, often with a riffle-pool (shallow and fast vs deeper and slow) sequence of habitats, and periodic (usually seasonal) high-flow events. Many organisms have specialised morphological and behavioural adaptations to high flow-velocity environments. Riparian trees produce copious leaf fall that provide allochthonous subsidies and support somewhat separate foodwebs to those based on in situ primary production by bryophytes and biofilms. Tree shade conversely light-limits productivity, a trade-off that relaxes seasonally where deciduous trees dominate. Microbes and detritivores (e.g. invertebrate shredders) break down leaf fall and other organic matter. Microbial biofilms comprising algae, fungi and bacteria establish on rocks and process dissolved organic matter. Invertebrates include shredders (consuming coarse particles), grazers (consuming biofilm), collectors and filter feeders (consuming benthic and suspended fine particles, respectively), and predators. Many benthic macroinvertebrates, mostly insects, have aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults. Filter feeders have traits adapted to swift flows, allowing them to hold fast to substrates while capturing resources, while benthic bryophytes provide shelter for other organisms. Fish are typically small predators of aquatic invertebrates and insects on the water surface. Birds typically have specialised foraging behaviours (e.g. dippers and kingfishers). Trophic cascades involving rapid algal growth, invertebrate grazers and fish are common.

# Key Ecological Drivers

Upland streams have flash flow regimes with high velocity and relatively low, but variable perennial volume. Turbulence sustains highly oxygenation. Groundwater-delivered subsidies support streamflow, with up to 50% of summer flow and 100% of winter flow originating as groundwater. This modulates stream temperatures, keeping temperatures lower in summer and higher in winter; and deliver nutrients, especially if there are N-fixing plants along the groundwater flow path. They flow down moderate to steep slopes causing considerable erosion and sediment transport. These factors drive nutrient and organic matter transport downstream. Flow volume and variability, including periodic flood regimes, depend on rainfall seasonality, snowmelt from cold-climate catchments, as well as catchment size. Peat-rich catchments feed dark dystrophic waters to the streams.

# Distribution

High proportion of global stream length. In steep to moderate terrain throughout the humid tropical and temperate zones, rarely extending to boreal latitudes.
