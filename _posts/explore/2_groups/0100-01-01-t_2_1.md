SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 
Evergreen, structurally simple forests and woodlands in cold climates are dominated by needle-leaf conifers and may include a subdominant component of deciduous trees, especially in disturbed sites, accounting for up to two-thirds of stand-level leaf biomass. Boreal forests are generally less diverse, more cold tolerant and support a more migratory fauna than temperate montane forests. Structure varies from dense forest up to 30m tall to stunted open woodlands less than 5m tall. Large trees engineer habitats of many fungi, non-vascular plants, invertebrates and vertebrates that depend onrugose bark, coarse woody debris or large tree canopies. Energy is mainly from autochthonous sources, but may include allochthonous subsidies from migratory vertebrates. Primary productivity is limited by seasonal cold and may also be limited by water deficit on coarse textured soils. Forested bogs occupy peaty soils (TF1.6). Seasonal primary productivity may sustain a trophic web with high densities of small and large herbivores (e.g. hare, bear, deer, insects), with feline, canine and raptor predators. Browsers are top-down regulators of plant biomass and cyclers of nitrogen, carbon and nutrients. Forest structure may be disrupted by insect defoliation or fires on multi-decadal cycles. Tree recruitment is limited by spring frost, desiccation, permafrost fluctuations, herbivory, surface fires. It occurs semi-continuously in gaps or episodically following canopy fires. Plants and animals have strongly seasonal growth and reproductive phenology and possess morphological, behavioural and ecophysiological traits enabling cold-tolerance and exploitation of short growing seasons. Plant traits include bud protection, extra-cellular freezing tolerance, hardened evergreen needle leaves with low SLA or deciduous leaves with high SLA, cold-stratification seed dormancy, seasonal geophytic growth forms and vegetative storage organs. Tracheids in conifers confer resistance to cavitation in drought by compartmentalising water transport tissues. Some large herbivores and most birds migrate to winter habitats from the boreal zone, and thus function as mobile links, dispersing other biota and bringing allochthonous subsidies of energy and nutrients into the system. Hibernation is common among sedentary vertebrates, while insect life cycles have adult phases cued to spring emergence.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
These systems are driven by large seasonal temperature ranges, cold winters with prolonged winter snow, low light, short growing seasons (1-3 months averaging above 10°C) and severe post-thaw frosts. There is an overall water surplus, but annual precipitation can be <200mm. Soil moisture recharged by winter snow sustains the system through evapotranspiration peaks in summer, but moisture can be limiting where these systems extend to mountains in warm semi-arid latitudes. The acid soils usually accumulate peat, and upper horizons may be frozen in winter. The forests may be prone to lightning-induced canopy fires on century time scales and surface fires on multi-decadal scales.
 
# Distribution
 
Boreal distribution across Eurasia and North America, extending to temperate (rarely subtropical) latitudes on mountains.

The distribution for this functional group was approximated from a model of the spatial distribution of terrestrial habitat types (Jung et al. 2020). Occurrences were aggregated to half degree spatial resolution and cells reclassified as major occurrences (>25%) and minor occurrences (< 25%) .
