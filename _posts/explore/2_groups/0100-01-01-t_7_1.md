SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 
Structurally simple, very low-diversity, high-productivity annual croplands are maintained by the intensive anthropogenic supplementation of nutrients, water, and artificial disturbance regimes (<i>e.g.</i> annual cultivation), translocation (<i>e.g.</i> sowing), and harvesting of annual plants. These systems are dominated by one or few shallow-rooted annual plant species such as grains (mostly C<sub>3</sub> grasses), vegetables, ‘flowers’, legumes, or fibre species harvested annually by humans for the commercial or subsistence production of food, materials, or ornamental displays. Disequilibrium community structure and composition is maintained by translocations and/or managed reproduction of target species and the periodic application of herbicides and pesticides and/or culling to exclude competitors, predators, herbivores, and/or pathogens. Consequently, these systems have very low functional, genetic, and taxonomic diversity and no local endemism. Productivity is highly sensitive to variations in resource availability. Target biota are genetically manipulated by selective breeding or molecular engineering to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, insect predators, and diseases. Croplands may be rotated inter-annually with livestock pastures or fallow fields ([T7.2](/explore/groups/T7.2)). Target biota coexists with a cosmopolitan ruderal biota (<i>e.g.</i> weedy plants, mice, and starlings) that exploits production landscapes opportunistically through efficient dispersal, itinerant foraging, rapid establishment, high fecundity, and rapid population turnover. When actively managed systems are abandoned or managed less intensively, these non-target biota, especially non-woody plants, become dominant and may form a steady, self-maintaining state or a transitional phase to novel ecosystems.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
The high to moderate natural availability of water (from at least seasonally high rainfall) and nutrients (from fertile soils) is supplemented by human inputs via irrigation, landscape drainage modifications (<i>e.g.</i> surface earthworks), and/or fertiliser application by humans. Intermittent flooding may occur where croplands replace palustrine wetlands. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. These systems are typically associated with flat to moderate terrain accessible by machinery. Artificial disturbance regimes (<i>e.g.</i> annual ploughing) maintain soil turnover, aeration, nutrient release, and relatively low soil organic carbon content.
 
# Distribution
 
Tropical to temperate humid climatic zones or river flats in dry climates across south sub-Saharan and North Africa, Europe, Asia, southern Australia, Oceania, and the Americas.

Major and minor occurrences were identified using consensus land-cover maps (Tuanmu et al. 2014) cropped to selected terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017).
