SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 
The whole surface of these lakes is frozen for at least 40% of the year. Allochthonous and autochthonous energy sources vary with lake and catchment features. Productivity is highly seasonal, sustained in winter largely by metabolism of microbial photoautotrophs and zooplankton that remain active under low light, nutrients and temperatures. Spring thaw initiates a seasonal succession, increasing productivity and re-establishing complex trophic networks, depending on lake area, depth, connectivity and nutrient availability. Diatoms are first to become photosynthetically active, followed by small and motile forms, cyanobacteria, and then zooplankton respond to increased food availability. Large lakes with high habitat complexity (e.g. Baikal) support phytoplankton, zooplankton, macrophytes (in shallow waters), invertebrate consumers, migratory fish (in connected lakes), waterbirds and mammals. Their upper trophic levels are more abundant, diverse and endemic than in smaller lakes. Herbivorous fish and zooplankton are significant top-down regulators of the main primary producers (biofilms and phytoplankton). These, in turn, are regulated by predatory fish, which may be limited by prey availability and competition. The biota is spatially structured by seasonally dynamic gradients in cold stratification, light, nutrient levels and turbulence. Traits such as resting stages, dormancy, freeze-cued spore production in phytoplankton and ability of fish to access low oxygen exchange enable persistence through cold winters under the ice and strongly seasonal patterns of nutrient availability.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Seasonal freeze-thaw cycles generate typically dimictic temperature stratification regimes, where cold water lies above warm water in winter and vice versa in summer. Shallow lakes are often polymictic during summer and may freeze completely during winter. Mixing occurs in autumn and spring. Freezing reduces light penetration and turbulence, enhancing depth gradients in temperature, oxygen and nutrients. Ice also limits atmospheric inputs, including gas exchange. Very low temperatures reduce growth rates, diversity and abundance of fish. Lake size varies from less than 1 ha to more than 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>, profoundly affecting niche diversity and trophic complexity. Freezing effects vary with the area and depth of lakes. Thawing is often accompanied by flooding in spring, ameliorating light and temperature gradients and increasing mixing. Dark water inflow from peatlands in catchments influence water chemistry, light penetration and productivity.
 
# Distribution
 
Predominantly across the high latitude northern hemisphere and high altitude South America.
