This uppermost ocean layer (0-200m depth) is the most influenced by the atmosphere, and is defined and structured by light availability. Photosynthesis in these ecosystems accounts for half of all global carbon fixation. That productivity supports diverse marine life, including many visual predators, like tuna, that rely on the high light environment. Migration is a common life history trait across all groups: either vertical – rising from the depths to feed at the surface at night to evade daytime predators; or horizontal – between breeding and feeding grounds. Detritus from this zone is an important nutrient source for lower oceanic layers.

# Ecosystem Properties
 
The epipelagic or euphotic zone of the open ocean is the uppermost layer that is penetrated by enough light to support photosynthesis. The vast area of the ocean means that autochthonous productivity in the epipelagic layer, largely by diatoms, accounts for around half of all global carbon fixation. This in turn supports a complex trophic network and high biomass of diatoms, copepods (resident and vertical migrants), fish, cephalopods, marine mammals, and seabirds, including fast-swimming visual predators taking advantage of the high-light environment. The suitability of conditions for recruitment and reproduction depends on the characteristics of the water column, which vary spatially and impact productivity rates, species composition, and community size structure. Mid-ocean subtropical gyres, for example, are characteristically oligotrophic, with lower productivity than other parts of the ocean surface. In contrast to the rest of the epipelagic zone, upwelling zones are characterised by specific patterns of water movement that drive high nutrient levels, productivity, and abundant forage fish, and are therefore included in a different functional group ([M1.9](/explore/groups/M1.9)). Seasonal variation in productivity is greater at high latitudes due to lower light penetration and duration in winter compared to summer. The habitat and lifecycle of some specialised pelagic species (e.g. herbivorous copepods, flying fish) are entirely contained within epipelagic ocean waters, but many commonly occurring crustaceans, fish, and cephalopods undertake either diel or ontogenetic vertical migration between the epipelagic and deeper oceanic layers. These organisms exploit the food available in the productive epipelagic zone either at night (when predation risk is lower) or for the entirety of their less mobile, juvenile life stages. Horizontal migration is also common and some species (e.g. tuna and migratory whales) swim long distances to feed and reproduce. Other species use horizontal currents for passive migration, particularly smaller planktonic organisms or life stages, e.g. copepods and small pelagic fish larvae moving between spawning and feeding grounds. Unconsumed plankton and dead organisms sink from this upper oceanic zone, providing an important particulate source of nutrients to deeper, aphotic zones.

# Ecological Drivers
 
The epipelagic zone is structured by a strong depth gradient in light, which varies seasonally at high latitudes. Light also varies with local turbidity, but at lower latitudes may extend to ~200 m where light attenuates to 1% of surface levels. Interaction at the surface between the ocean and atmosphere leads to increased seasonality, mixing, and warming, and makes this the most biologically and physicochemically variable ocean layer. Nutrient levels are spatially variable as a result. Salinity varies with terrestrial freshwater inputs, evaporation, and mixing, with greater variation in semi-enclosed areas (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea) than the open ocean.
 
# Distribution
 
The surface layer of the entire open ocean beyond the near-shore zone.

Indicative distributions of these marine pelagic ecosystem functional groups were derived from bathymetric spatial data obtained from Becker _et al._ (2009) using depth range thresholds cited in respective descriptive profiles for each functional group. Occurrences were mapped at 30 arc second spatial resolution.
