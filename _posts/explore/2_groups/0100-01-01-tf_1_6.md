SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 
These patterned peatlands are dominated by a dense cover (high LAI) of hydrophytic mosses, graminoids and shrubs, sometimes with scattered trees. Positive feedbacks involving peat formation maintain specialised interactions between vegetation, hydrology and substrate chemistry. Peat (partially decayed remains of plants) and dense ground vegetation promote water retention, and support further peat growth, accounting for up to 40% of global soil carbon. Moderate-low primary production is partially broken down at the soil surface by anamorphic fungi and aerobic bacteria. Burial by overgrowth and saturation by the water table promotes anaerobic conditions, limiting subsurface microbial activity. This is further constrained by nutrient scarcity, acidity and low temperatures, so that organic deposition exceeds decomposition. Plant diversity is low but fine-scale hydrological gradients structure vegetation mosaics, which may include fens ([TF1.7](/explore/groups/TF1.7)). Mosses (notably Sphagnum) and graminoids (notably Cyperaceae) with layering growth forms strongly promote peat formation.  Their relative abundance influences microbial communities and peat biochemistry. Plant traits such as lacunate stem tissues, aerenchyma and surface root mats promote oxygen transport into the anaerobic substrate. Woody plant foliage is small (leptophyll-microphyll) and sclerophyllous, reflecting excess carbohydrate production in low-nutrient conditions. Plants and fungi reproduce primarily by cloning, except where disturbances (<i>e.g.</i> fires) initiate gaps enabling recruitment. Invertebrates are dominant consumers in the trophic network, with dipterans, dragonflies and lepidopterans prominent herbivores as larvae, and pollinators and predators as adults. Carnivorous plants (<i>e.g.</i> sundews) support nitrogen cycling. Vertebrates are mostly itinerant, but include specialised resident amphibians, skinks, rodents and birds. Some regions are rich in locally endemic flora and fauna, particularly in the southern hemisphere.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Bogs are restricted to cool humid climates where moisture inputs (precipitation, seepage and surface inflow) exceed outputs (evapotranspiration, percolation, run-off) for extended periods, enabling these systems to function as landscape sponges. Seasonally low temperatures and/or frequent cloud cover limit evapotranspiration. Substrates are waterlogged, anaerobic, highly organic (usually >30% dry weight), acidic (pH 3.5 – 6) and nutrient-poor. Peat growth may produce raised ombrotrophic bogs, entirely fed by rain, but if minerotrophic inflows from catchments occur, they provide limited nutrient subsidies (cf. [TF1.7](/explore/groups/TF1.7)). Fires may occur in dry summers, sometimes igniting peat with long term consequences for ecosystem function and stability.
 
# Distribution
 
Extensive across boreal-subarctic latitudes, with small areas on tropical mountains of South America, New Guinea and central Africa and at cool temperate southern latitudes in Patagonia and Australasia.

Terrestrial ecoregions containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (Dinerstein et al. 2017), global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and experts.
