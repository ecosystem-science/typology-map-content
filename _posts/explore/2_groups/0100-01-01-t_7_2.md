SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 
Structurally simple, low-diversity, high-productivity pastures are maintained by the intensive anthropogenic supplementation of nutrients (more rarely water) and artificial disturbance regimes (<i>e.g.</i> periodic ploughing,), translocation (<i>e.g.</i> sowing and livestock movement), and harvesting of animals or plants. They are dominated by one or few selected plant species (C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> perennial pasture grasses and/or herbaceous legumes) and animal species (usually large mammalian herbivores) for commercial production of food or materials, ornamental displays, or, rarely, subsistence. Their composition and structure is maintained by the translocation and/or managed reproduction of target species and the periodic application of herbicides and pesticides and/or culling to exclude competitors, predators, herbivores, or pathogens. Consequently, these systems have low functional and taxonomic diversity and no local endemism. Target biota are genetically manipulated to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, predators, and diseases. They are harvested by humans continuously or periodically for consumption. Major examples include intensively managed production pastures for livestock or forage (<i>e.g.</i> hay), lawns, and sporting fields. Livestock pastures may be rotated inter-annually with non-woody crops ([T7.1](/explore/groups/T7.1)). Target biota coexist with a cosmopolitan ruderal biota that exploits production landscapes through efficient dispersal, rapid establishment, high fecundity, and rapid population turnover. When the ecosystem is abandoned or managed less intensively, non-target biota become dominant and may form a steady, self-maintaining state or a transitional phase to novel ecosystems.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
High to moderate natural availability of water and nutrients is supplemented by human inputs via water management, landscape drainage modifications (<i>e.g.</i> surface earthworks), and/or fertiliser application. Intermittent flooding may occur where pastures replace palustrine wetlands. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. Typically associated with moderately fertile substrates and flat to undulating terrain accessible by machinery. Artificial disturbance regimes (<i>e.g.</i> ploughing for up to 5 years/decade) maintain soil turnover, aeration, and nutrient release.
 
# Distribution
 
Mostly in subtropical to temperate climatic zones and developed countries across Europe, east and south Asia, subtropical and temperate Africa, southern Australasia, north and central America, and temperate south America.

Major and minor occurrences were identified using consensus land-cover maps (Tuanmu et al. 2014) cropped to selected terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017).
