SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 

Deepwater coastal inlets (mostly fjords) are semi-confined aquatic systems with many features of open oceans. Strong influences from adjacent freshwater and terrestrial systems produce striking environmental and biotic gradients. Autochthonous energy sources are dominant, but allochthonous sources (glacial ice discharge, freshwater streams, seasonal permafrost meltwater) may contribute 10% or more of particulate organic matter (POM). Planktonic algae, notably diatoms, contribute most of the primary production supplemented by biofilms and macroalgae in the epibenthic layer. Seasonal variation in inflow, temperatures, ice cover and insolation drives pulses of in situ and imported productivity that generate blooms? in diatoms, consumed in turn by jellyfish, microneckton, a hierarchy of fish predators, and marine mammals. Fish are limited by food, density-dependent predation, and cannibalism. In addition to driving pelagic trophic networks, seasonal pulses of diatoms shape biogeochemical cycles, and the distribution and biomass of benthic biota. This is because a large mass of diatoms tends to senesce and sink to the bottom, escaping herbivores, which are limited by predators. Vertical flux of diatoms, macrophytes and terrestrial detritus sustains a diversity and abundance of benthic filter feeders (<i>e.g.</i>, maldanids, oweniids). Environmental and biotic heterogeneity underpins functional and compositional contrasts between individual inlets and strong gradients within them. Zooplankton, fish and jellies distribute in response to resource heterogeneity and environmental cues, as well as interactions with other organisms. Inlets with warmer water are considered more ‘mature’ due to their stronger pelagic-benthic coupling and more complex trophic webs. They utilise a greater fraction of organic carbon and sequester it in sea floor sediments at a slower rate.

 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 

Deepwater coastal systems may exceed 300 km in length and 2000 m in depth. Almost all have glacial origins and many are fed by active glaciers. The ocean interface at the mouth of the inlets, strongly influenced by regional currents, interacts with large seasonal inputs of freshwater to the inner inlet and wind-driven advection to produce strong and dynamic spatial gradients in nutrients, salinity and organic carbon. Advection is critical to productivity and carrying capacity in the system. It drives water movement in the upper and lower layers of the water column in different directions and thus links the inlet waters with coastal water masses. Coastal currents also mediate upwelling and downwelling depending on their direction of flow. However, submerged glacial moraines or sills at the inlet mouth may limit marine mixing, which can be limited to seasonal episodes in spring and autumn. Depth gradients in light typically extend beyond the photic zone, and are exacerbated at high latitudes by seasonal variation in insolation and surface ice. Vertical fluxes also create strong depth gradients in nutrients, oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, salinity and temperature.

 
# Distribution
 

Historically or currently glaciated coastlines at polar and cool temperate latitudes.


Marine ecoregions (Spalding et al. 2008) containing major or minor occurrences of each ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting global and regional reviews, maps of relevant ecosystems, and expertise of authors. Marine ecoregions containing Deepwater inlets were clipped to the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014).
