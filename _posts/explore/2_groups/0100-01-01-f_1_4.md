title: F1.4 Seasonal upland streams

Between wet and dry seasons, highly variable flows occur in narrow and steep upland streams of seasonal tropical, subtropical and temperate regions worldwide. Many dry seasonally, with water persisting in isolated stagnant pools, while others maintain low flows. Algae and leaf fall contribute to moderate productivity, with seasonal floods sending organic matter downstream. Diversity fluctuates seasonally, with specialised traits enabling fauna to survive both flooding and dry conditions.

# Ecological Traits
 
Upland streams (orders 1-4) with highly  seasonal flows generally have low to moderate productivity and a simpler trophic structure than lowland rivers. They tend to be shallow, hence benthic algae are major contributors to in-stream food webs and productivity, but riparian zones and catchments both contribute allochthonous energy and organic Carbon through leaf fall, which may include an annual deciduous component. Primary production also varies with light availability and flow. Taxonomic diversity varies between streams, but can be lower than permanent streams and relatively high in endemism. Traits that enable biota to persist in narrow and shallow channels with large seasonal variations in flow velocity, episodes of torrential flow, and seasonal desiccation include small body sizes (especially in resident fish), dormant life phases and/or burrowing (crustaceans), omnivorous diets and high dispersal ability, including seasonal migration. Compared to lowland rivers, the trophic structure has a higher representation of algal and omnivorous feeders and low numbers of larger predators. Birds show specialist feeding strategies (e.g. dippers). Diversity and abundance of invertebrates and their predators (e.g. birds) fluctuate in response to seasonal flood regimes.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Flow and flood regimes in these rivers are highly variable between marked wet and dry seasons, with associated changes in water quality as solute concentration varies with volume. They may be perennial, with flows much-reduced in the dry season, or seasonally intermittent with flows ceasing and water persisting in isolated stagnant pools. Channels are narrow with steep to moderate gradients and seasonally high velocity and sometimes large volumes of water, producing overbank flows. This results in considerable turbulence, turbidity, and erosion during the wet season and coarse substrates (cobbles and boulders). Seasonal floods are critical to allochtonous subsidies and downstream exports of organic matter and nutrients.
 
# Distribution
 
Elevated regions in seasonal tropical, subtropical and temperate climates worldwide.
