title: T7.5 Derived semi-natural pastures and old fields
version: v2.0, 2020-05-31 21:58:35
---

Extensive ''semi-natural'' grasslands and open shrublands exist where woody components of vegetation have been removed or greatly reduced in cover for agricultural land uses. Hence they have been ''derived'' from a range of other ecosystems. The remaining vegetation includes a substantial component of local indigenous species, as well as an introduced exotic component, providing habitat for a mixed indigenous and non-indigenous fauna. Availability of water and nutrients varies depending on local climate, substrate and terrain. The structure, function and composition of these ecosystems are shaped by the legacy of the original ecosystems, as well as ongoing and past human activities. Mostly in temperate to tropical climatic zones across all land masses.

# Ecological Traits
 
Extensive ‘semi-natural’ grasslands and open shrublands exist where woody components of vegetation have been removed or greatly modified for agricultural land uses. Hence they have been ‘derived’ from a range of other ecosystems (mostly from biomes T1-T4, a few from T5). Remaining vegetation includes a substantial component of local indigenous species, as well as an introduced exotic element, providing habitat for a mixed indigenous and non-indigenous fauna. Although structurally simpler than the systems from which they were derived, they often harbour an appreciable diversity of native organisms, including some no longer present in ‘natural’ ecosystems. Dominant plant growth forms include tussock or stoloniferous grasses and forbs, with or without non-vascular plants, shrubs and scattered trees. These support microbial decomposers and diverse invertebrate groups that function as detritivores, herbivores and predators, as well as vertebrate herbivores and predators characteristic of open habitats. Energy sources are primarily autochthonous, with varying levels of indirect allochthonous subsidies (<i>e.g.</i> via surface water sheet flows), but few managed inputs (cf. [T7.2](/explore/groups/T7.2)). Productivity can be low-high, depending on climate and substrate, but is generally lower and more stable than more intensive anthropogenic systems ([T7.1](/explore/groups/T7.1)-[T7.3](/explore/groups/T7.3)). Trophic networks include all levels, but complexity and diversity depends on the species pool, legacies from antecedent ecosystems, successional stage, and management regimes. These novel ecosystems may persist in a steady self-maintaining state, or undergo passive transformation (<i>e.g.</i> oldfield succession) unless actively maintained in disequilibrium. For example, removal of domestic herbivores may initiate transition to tree-dominated ecosystems.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Availability of water and nutrients varies depending on local climate, substrate and terrain (hence surface water movement and infiltration). The structure, function and composition of these ecosystems are shaped by legacy features of antecedent systems from which they were derived, as well as ongoing and past human activities. These activities may reflect production and/or conservation goals, or abandonment. They include active removal of woody vegetation, management of vertebrate herbivores, introductions of biota, control of ‘pest’ biota, manipulation of disturbance regimes, drainage and earthworks, etc. Fertilisers and pesticides are not commonly applied.
 
# Distribution
 
Mostly in temperate to tropical climatic zones across all land masses.
