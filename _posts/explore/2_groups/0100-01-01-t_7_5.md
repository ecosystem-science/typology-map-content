title: T7.5 Derived semi-natural pastures and old fields
version: 'v2.1, 2022-04-06 05:02:01'
---

These managed ecosystems are derived from a range of other ecosystems (mostly from [T1](/explore/biomes/T1) - [T4](/explore/biomes/T4), a few from [T5](/explore/biomes/T5)) by the removal or modification of woody plant components. The remaining vegetation includes both local indigenous species and introduced species, providing habitat for a mixed indigenous and non-indigenous fauna. They are used mainly for livestock grazing, which is essential to maintaining the structure of the system. Unlike sown pastures, inputs of water and nutrients are limited. Although structurally simpler than the systems from which they were derived, they often harbour an appreciable diversity of native organisms.

# Ecological Traits
 
Extensive ‘semi-natural’ grasslands and open shrublands exist where woody components of vegetation have been removed or greatly modified for agricultural land uses. Hence they have been ‘derived’ from a range of other ecosystems (mostly from biomes [T1](/explore/biomes/T1), [T2](/explore/biomes/T2), [T3](/explore/biomes/T3), [T4](/explore/biomes/T4), a few from [T5](/explore/biomes/T5)). Remaining vegetation includes a substantial component of local indigenous species, as well as an introduced exotic element, providing habitat for a mixed indigenous and non-indigenous fauna. Although structurally simpler at site scales than the systems from which they were derived, spatial complexity may be greater in fragmented landscapes and they often harbour appreciable diversity of native organisms, including some no longer present in ‘natural’ ecosystems. Dominant plant growth forms include tussock or stoloniferous grasses and forbs, with or without non-vascular plants, shrubs and scattered trees. These support microbial decomposers and diverse invertebrate groups that function as detritivores, herbivores and predators, as well as vertebrate herbivores and predators characteristic of open habitats. Energy sources are primarily autochthonous, with varying levels of indirect allochthonous subsidies (e.g. via surface water sheet flows), but few managed inputs (cf. [T7.2](/explore/groups/T7.2)). Productivity can be low or high, depending on climate and substrate, but is generally lower and more stable than more intensive anthropogenic systems ([T7.1](/explore/groups/T7.1)-[T7.3](/explore/groups/T7.3)). Trophic networks include all levels, but complexity and diversity depends on the species pool, legacies from antecedent ecosystems, successional stage, and management regimes. These novel ecosystems may persist in a steady self-maintaining state, or undergo passive transformation (e.g. oldfield succession) unless actively maintained in disequilibrium. For example, removal of domestic herbivores may initiate transition to tree-dominated ecosystems.

# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Availability of water and nutrients varies depending on local climate, substrate and terrain (hence surface water movement and infiltration). The structure, function and composition of these ecosystems are shaped by legacy features of antecedent systems from which they were derived, as well as ongoing and past human activities. These activities may reflect production and/or conservation goals, or abandonment. They include active removal of woody vegetation, management of vertebrate herbivores, introductions of biota, control of ‘pest’ biota, manipulation of disturbance regimes, drainage and earthworks, etc. Fertilisers and pesticides are not commonly applied.
 
# Distribution
 
Mostly in temperate to tropical climates across all land masses.

Major and minor occurrences were initially identified using consensus land-cover maps (Tuanmu _et al._ 2014) and then cropped to selected terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein _et al._ 2017) at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution. Ecoregions were selected if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile.
