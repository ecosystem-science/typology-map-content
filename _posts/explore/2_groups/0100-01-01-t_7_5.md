title: T7.5 Derived semi-natural pastures and old fields
version: 'v2.1, 2022-04-06 05:02:01'
---

These managed ecosystems are derived from a range of other ecosystems (mostly from [T1](/explore/biomes/T1) - [T4](/explore/biomes/T4), a few from [T5](/explore/biomes/T5)) by the removal or modification of woody plant components. The remaining vegetation includes both local indigenous species and introduced species, providing habitat for a mixed indigenous and non-indigenous fauna. They are used mainly for livestock grazing, which is essential to maintaining the structure of the system. Unlike sown pastures, inputs of water and nutrients are limited. Although structurally simpler than the systems from which they were derived, they often harbour an appreciable diversity of native organisms.

# Ecosystem Properties
 
Extensive ‘semi-natural’ grasslands and open shrublands exist where woody components of vegetation have been removed or greatly modified for agricultural land uses. Hence they have been ‘derived’ from a range of other ecosystems (mostly from biomes [T1](/explore/biomes/T1), [T2](/explore/biomes/T2), [T3](/explore/biomes/T3), [T4](/explore/biomes/T4), a few from [T5](/explore/biomes/T5)). Remaining vegetation includes a substantial component of local indigenous species, as well as an introduced exotic element, providing habitat for a mixed indigenous and non-indigenous fauna. Although structurally simpler at site scales than the systems from which they were derived, spatial complexity may be greater in fragmented landscapes and they often harbour appreciable diversity of native organisms, including some no longer present in ‘natural’ ecosystems. Dominant plant growth forms include tussock or stoloniferous grasses and forbs, with or without non-vascular plants, shrubs and scattered trees. These support microbial decomposers and diverse invertebrate groups that function as detritivores, herbivores and predators, as well as vertebrate herbivores and predators characteristic of open habitats. Energy sources are primarily autochthonous, with varying levels of indirect allochthonous subsidies (e.g. via surface water sheet flows), but few managed inputs (cf. [T7.2](/explore/groups/T7.2)). Productivity can be low or high, depending on climate and substrate, but is generally lower and more stable than more intensive anthropogenic systems ([T7.1](/explore/groups/T7.1)-[T7.3](/explore/groups/T7.3)). Trophic networks include all levels, but complexity and diversity depends on the species pool, legacies from antecedent ecosystems, successional stage, and management regimes. These novel ecosystems may persist in a steady self-maintaining state, or undergo passive transformation (e.g. oldfield succession) unless actively maintained in disequilibrium. For example, removal of domestic herbivores may initiate transition to tree-dominated ecosystems.

# Ecological Drivers
 
Availability of water and nutrients varies depending on local climate, substrate and terrain (hence surface water movement and infiltration). The structure, function and composition of these ecosystems are shaped by legacy features of antecedent systems from which they were derived, as well as ongoing and past human activities. These activities may reflect production and/or conservation goals, or abandonment. They include active removal of woody vegetation, management of vertebrate herbivores, introductions of biota, control of ‘pest’ biota, manipulation of disturbance regimes, drainage and earthworks, etc. Fertilisers and pesticides are not commonly applied.
 
# Distribution
 
Mostly in temperate to tropical climates across all land masses.

We used land use and land suitability datasets for the year 2000 (Erb _et al._ 2007) and Human Appropriation of Net Primary Productivity (Haberl _et al._ 2007) to estimate the distribution of semi-natural pastures. We selected areas that were: a) suitable for livestock grazing; b) had a greater proportion of grazing lands than croplands or forestry lands (grazing> forestry and grazing>cropland); c) had intermediate to high cover of grazing lands (>30%); and intermediate to high estimates of Human Appropriation of Net Primary Productivity (20%<HANPP <90%). In combination, these conditions excluded intensive pastures and wild rangelands with low productivity for livestocj grazing. We classified areas with the highest grazing suitability (class 1 in Erb _et al._ 2007) as major occurrences, and areas with the second highest grazing suitability (class 2) as minor occurrences. We acknowledge significant untested assumptions and limitations on spatial predictors that challenge the global-scale delineation of pasture ecosystems with varied levels of human influence. We therefore advise appropriate caution in use of the spatial data for quantitative analysis.
