SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 
Closed-canopy evergreen forests on tropical mountains usually have a single-layer low tree canopy (~ 5-20m tall) with small leaf sizes (microphyll-notphyll) and high SLA. Structure and taxonomic diversity become more diminutive and simpler with altitude, culminating in ‘elfinwood’ forms. Conspicuous epiphytic ferns, bryophytes, lichens, orchids and bromeliads drape tree branches and are able to exploit atmospheric moisture (cloud stripping), but grasses are rare or absent. Moderate productivity is fuelled by autochthonous energy sources, limited by cool temperatures, possibly high exposure to UV-B radiation and sometimes by shallow soil and/or wind exposure. Growth and reproductive phenology is aseasonal or weakly seasonal. Plant propagules are dispersed mostly by wind, also by territorial birds and mammals. Taxonomic diversity is moderate to low, especially in the tree canopy, but there is often high local endemism at higher altitudes in most groups, especially amphibia, birds, plants and invertebrates. Gap-phase dynamics is driven by individual tree-fall or lightning strikes, more rarely by extreme wind storms in some areas. Seedling banks are common (seedbanks uncommon), most plants are shade tolerant and able to recruit in shade.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Substantial cloud moisture and high humidity underpin a reliable year-round rainfall surplus over evapotranspiration. Altitudinal gradients in temperature, precipitation and exposure are pivotal in ecosystem structure and function. Frequent cloud cover from orographic uplift and closed tree canopies maintain a moist microclimate and shady conditions. Temperatures are mild-cool, decreasing with altitude but above 0°C in all months of the year, with low-moderate seasonal variability and moderate-high diurnal variability. Landslides are a significant form of disturbance that drives successional dynamics on steep slopes and are exacerbated by extreme rainfall events. Mountains experience elevated UV-B radiation with altitude and are exposed to tropical storms in some regions.
 
# Distribution
 
Humid tropical and subtropical regions in east Africa, east Madagascar, southeast Asia, west Oceania, northeast Australia, central and tropical south America.

The distribution of tropical montane rainforest was approximated from a model of the spatial distribution of terrestrial habitat types (Class *1.9. Forest – Subtropical/tropical moist montane* in: Jung et al. 2020). Occurrences were aggregated to half degree spatial resolution and cells reclassified as major occurrences (>25%) and minor occurrences (< 25%) .
