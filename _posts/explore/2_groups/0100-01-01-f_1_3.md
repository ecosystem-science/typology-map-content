In boreal, subarctic, alpine and subalpine regions, the surfaces of both small streams and large rivers freeze in winter. Freezing reduces nutrient inputs and light penetration, resulting in low functional and taxonomic diversity. Algae and phytoplankton are present seasonally.  Nutrients from spring meltwaters and vegetation along smaller streams contribute organic matter. Fauna have specialist traits for low temperatures, or come to forage in meltwater streams from spring to autumn.

# Ecological Traits
 
In seasonally cold montane or boreal environments, the surfaces of streams freeze in winter. These systems have relatively simple trophic networks with low functional and taxonomic diversity, but the biota may include a number of local endemics. Algae are the principal autotrophs, while benthic macrophytes are rare. They are seasonally inactive when temperatures are cold and surface ice reduces light penetration into the water column, limiting metabolic activity and in-stream productivity during winter. While bottom-up regulatory processes dominate, subsidies of dissolved organic carbon and nutrients brought by spring meltwaters from upper catchments and stream banks are crucial to maintaining the detritivores that dominate the trophic network. Resident invertebrates survive cold temperatures, sometimes through dormant life stages (e.g. cysts). Vertebrate habitat specialists (e.g. dippers, small fish species, beavers, otters) are able to tolerate low temperatures with traits such as subcutical fat, thick hydrophobic and/or aerated fir or feathers. Many fish disperse from frozen habitat to deeper water refuges during the winter (e.g. deep pools, lakes) before foraging in the meltwater streams during the spring to autumn period. They are a food source for itinerant terrestrial predators, such as bear.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
These rivers are characterised by low winter temperatures and seasonal freeze/thaw regimes. Winter freezing is generally limited to the surface. Flows may continue below the ice or may be intermittent in smaller streams or dry climates. Freezing reduces resource availability by depleting oxygen levels and nutrient concentrations and reducing light penetration through the water. Light may also be attenuated at high latitudes and by high turbidity in erosional streams. Meltwaters drive increased flow and flooding in spring and summer. Carbon and nutrient concentrations are greatest during spring floods, and pH tends to decrease with flow during spring and autumn. When catchments include extensive peatlands, waters may be tannin-rich, acidic and dark, reducing light penetration and productivity.
 
# Distribution
 
Restricted to boreal, subarctic, alpine and subalpine regions, with limited examples in the subantarctic and Antarctic.
