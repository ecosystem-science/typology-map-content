SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 
Ephemeral salt lakes or playas have relatively short-lived wet phases and long dry periods of years or decades. During filling phases, inflow dilutes salinity to moderate levels, and allochthonous energy and carbon inputs from lake catchments supplements autochthonous energy produced by abundant phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, submerged and emergent macrophytes and fringing halophytes. In drying phases, increasing salinity generally reduces diversity and top-down trophic regulation, but not necessarily abundance of organisms, except at hypersaline levels which suppress productivity. Trophic networks are simple, and characterised by few species that are often highly abundant during wet phases. The high biomass of archaeal and bacterial decomposers and phytoplankton, in turn support abundant consumers including crustaceans (e.g. brine shrimps, copepods) insects and other invertebrates, fish and specialist waterbirds (e.g. banded stilts). Predators and herbivores that become dominant at low salinity levels exert top-down control on algae and low-order consumers. Species niches are strongly structured by spatial and temporal salinity gradients and endorheic drainage promotes some regional endemism. Species that persist in the most saline conditions tend to have broad ranges of salinity tolerance. Many organisms regulate salinity osmotically, which has a high metabolic cost, limiting productivity and competitive ability with freshwater biota. Many specialised opportunists are able to exploit boom-bust resource cycles through life-cycle traits that promote persistence during dry periods (e.g.  desiccation-resistant e.g. in crustacea and/or rapid hatching, development, breeding and recruitment). Much of the biota (e.g. insects, birds) have widely dispersed adult phases enabling rapid colonisation. Filling events drive specialised succession, with short windows of opportunity to grow and reproduce, reset by drying until the next filling event.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Ephemeral salt lakes are up to 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> in area, and usually less than a few metres deep. They may be weakly vertically stratified (meromictic) due to slow mixing of freshwater inflow with higher density saltwater. Endorheic drainage promotes salt accumulation. Salinity varies temporally from 0.3% to over 26%, depending on lake size, depth temperature and the balance between freshwater inflows, precipitation and evaporation. Inflow is critical to ecosystem dynamics, by mediating wet-dry phases and driving indirect effects of salinity on trophic or ecosystem processes. Dissolved oxygen is inversely related to salinity, hence anoxia is common in hypersaline lake states. Ionic composition varies greatly, with carbonate, sulphate, sulphide, ammonia and/or phosphorus sometimes at high levels, and pH varying from 3 to 11.
 
# Distribution
 
Mostly in arid and semi-arid Africa, Eurasia, Australia and north and south America.
