SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 
These small (mostly <5 km<sup>2</sup> in area) and shallow (<1 m deep), seasonal freshwater lakes, vernal pools, or gnammas, are characterised by a seasonal aquatic biota. Local endemism may be high where hydrological isolation promotes biotic insularity, which occurs in some Mediterranean climate regions. Autochthonous energy sources are supplemented by limited allochthonous inputs from small catchments and groundwater. Seasonal variation in biota and productivity outweighs interannual variation, unlike ephemeral lakes (F2.5, F2.7). Filling induces microbial activity, germination of seeds and algal spores, growth and reproduction by specialists and opportunistic colonists. As productivity and biomass reach a peak, oxygen levels decline and there is denitrification from litter decomposition, respiration and metabolism by microbes, while methane and carbon dioxide can reach super saturation. Biomass and productivity decline during seasonal drying and many species senesce and enter dormant life stages or emigrate. Resident biota adapted to wet/dry phases (e.g. large branchiopods) have traits such as air-breathing and desiccation-resistant life stages. Amphibious, perennial macrophytes (sedges, shrubs, trees) may persist through dry phases, especially on lake margins. Trophic networks and niche diversity are driven by bottom-up processes, while complexity depends on lake size and productivity. Cyanobacteria, algae and macrophytes are the major primary producers. The most diverse lakes exhibit zonation and support phytoplankton, zooplankton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrate consumers, and seasonally resident amphibians, waterbirds and mammals. Juvenile amphibians (e.g. salamanders, burrowing frogs) may rely on these ecosystems for their aquatic phase. Invertebrates and amphibians reach high diversity and abundance in the absence of fish.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
Annual filling and drying is driven by seasonal rainfall and flows and seasonally high evapotranspiration, mostly in monsoonal and Mediterranean climates with marked tropical ‘winters’ or temperate summers, respectively. Impermeable substrates (clay, bedrock) impede infiltration, usually in upper catchments or undulating lowlands. Small catchments, low-relief terrain, high area to volume ratios and hydrological isolation promote seasonal fluctuation. These hydrogeomorphic features also limit nutrient supply, in turn limiting pH buffering. High rates of organic decomposition, dentritification and sediment retention are driven by water fluctuations. High alkalinity reflects high anaerobic respiration. Groundwater flows may ameliorate hydrological isolation. Seasonal filling and drying induce much spatio-temporal variability in temperature, depth, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity and nutrients, resulting in zonation within lakes and high variability among them.
 
# Distribution
 
Mainly in sub-humid temperate and wet/dry tropical regions, in monsoonal and Mediterranean-type climates, but usually not semi-arid or arid regions.
