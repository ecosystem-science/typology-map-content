SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 

These shallow permanently inundated freshwater systems wetlands lack woody vegetation, but are dominated instead by emergent macrophytes growing in extensive, often monospecific groves of rhizomatous grasses, sedges, rushes or reeds in mosaics with patches of open water. These plants, together with phytoplankton, algal mats, epiphytes, floating and amphibious herbs sustain high primary productivity and strong bottom-up regulation. Although most energy comes from these functionally diverse autotrophs, inflow and seepage from catchments may contribute significant allochthonous energy and nutrients. Plant traits including aerenchymatous stem and leaf tissues enable oxygen transport to roots and long rhizomes, and into the substrate. Invertebrate and microbial detritivores and decomposers inhabit the water column and substrate, but their activity is limited by low oxygen levels, and organic deposition continually exceeds decomposition. Their aquatic predators include invertebrates and small fish. The emergent vegetation supports a complex trophic web including insects with winged adult phases, waterbirds, reptiles and mammals, which feed in the vegetation and also use it for nesting (e.g.Â herons, muskrat, alligators). Waterbirds include herbivores, detritivores and predators. Many plants and animals disperse widely through air and water. Reproduction and recruitment coincide with resource availability and may be cued to floods. Most macrophytes spread vegetatively with long rhizomes, but also produce an abundance of wind-dispersed seeds.

 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 

These systems occur in several geomorphic settings, including lake shores, groundwater seeps, river floodplains and deltas, always in low energy depositional environments. Shallow but perennial inundation and low variability are maintained by frequent floods, lake waters, sometimes independently of local climate. This sustains high levels of water and nutrients, but also sustains substrate anoxia. Substrates are typically organic. Their texture varies, but silt and clay substrates are associated with high levels of phosphorous and nitrogen. Salinity is low, but maybe transitional where wetlands connect with brackish lagoons (FM1.2, FM1.3). Fires may  occur in some areas, but are not pervasive drivers of these systems.

 
# Distribution
 

Scattered throughout the tropics and temperate regions of the world.
