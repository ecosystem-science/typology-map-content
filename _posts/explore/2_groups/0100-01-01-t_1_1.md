These are small rivers or streams in mountainous or hilly areas, with steep gradients and fast flow. They flow all year, increasing in wet periods, in humid tropical and temperate zones. Stones are common along their rapids and pools, turning over and oxygenating the water. Dependent organisms are specialised for these high flow-velocity environments, receiving resources for food webs from the river and adjacent and upstream vegetation.
