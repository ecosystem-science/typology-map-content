SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 
Sclerophyllous, evergreen shrublands are distinctive ecosystems of humid and subhumid climates in mid latitudes. Their low-moderate productivity is fuelled by autochthonous energy sources and is limited by resource constraints and/or recurring disturbance. Vegetation is dominated by shrubs with very low SLA, high C:N ratios, shade-intolerance and long-lived, small, often ericoid leaves, with or without a low open canopy of sclerophyll trees. The ground layer may include geophytes and sclerophyll graminoids, though less commonly ‘true grasses’. Trophic webs are relatively simple, with large mammalian predators scarce or absent, and low densities of vertebrate herbivores. Diversity and local endemism may be high among vascular plants and invertebrate consumers. Plants and animals are equipped with morphological, ecophysiological and life-history traits that promote persistence under summer droughts, nutrient poverty and recurring fires, which play a role in top-down regulation. Stomatal regulation and root architecture promote drought tolerance in plants. Cluster roots and acid exudates, mycorrhizae and insectivory promote nutrient capture, while cellulose, lignin and exudate production and leaf longevity promote nutrient conservation in plants. Vertebrate herbivores and granivores possess specialised dietary and digestive traits enabling consumption of foliage with low nutrient content and secondary compounds. Decomposition rates are slow, allowing litter fuel accumulation to add to well-aerated fine fuels in shrub canopies.  Life-history traits  such as recovery organs, serotiny, post-fire seedling recruitment, pyrogenic flowering and fire-related germination cues promote plant survival, growth and reproduction under recurring canopy fires, while animals evade fires in burrows or through mobility. Animal pollination syndromes are common (notably dipterans lepidopterans, birds and sometimes mammals) and ants may be prominent in seed dispersal.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
A marked summer water deficit and a modest winter surplus is driven by high summer temperatures and evapotranspiration with winter-maximum or aseasonal rainfall patterns Winters are mild. Sandy soil textures exacerbate an overall water deficit. Soils are typically acid, derived from siliceous sand deposits, sandstones or acid intrusives or volcanics, and are low to very low in P, N and mineral cations (though this varies between regions). The climate, soils and vegetation promote summer canopy fires at decadal to multi-decadal intervals. Positive feedbacks between fire and vegetation may be important in maintaining flammability.
 
# Distribution
 
Mediterranean-type climate regions of Europe, north and south Africa, southern Australia, western North and South America, and occurrences in non-Mediterranean climates in eastern Australia, USA and Argentina.

The distribution for this functional group was approximated from a model of the spatial distribution of terrestrial habitat types (Jung et al. 2020). Occurrences were aggregated to half degree spatial resolution and cells reclassified as major occurrences (>25%) and minor occurrences (< 25%) .
