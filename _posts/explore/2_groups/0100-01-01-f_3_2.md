SHORT DESCRIPTION IN PREPARATION

# Ecological Traits
 
Shallow open water bodies have been constructed in a wide range of landscape and climate types. They may be fringed by amphibious vegetation, which rarely extends across the entire extent, or else bare ground maintained by earthworks or livestock trampling. Productivity varies from highly productive wastewater treatment ponds to low productivity mining and excavation pits depending on management. Biota generally tolerate high pollutant levels. Taxonomic and functional diversity are typically low and depend on productivity, presence of aquatic vegetation and proximity to other waterbodies. Trophic structure is often simplified to phytoplankton, microbial detritivores and their planktonic and invertebrate predators dominating limnetic zones. Spatial zonation is limited but shallow littoral zones may support aquatic macrophytes and higher trophic levels including macroinvertebrates, amphibians and waterbirds. Fish are usually absent except in aquaculture ponds (F3.4). Life-histories depend on the hydroperiod but most species are widely dispersed opportunists, hence endemism is low. Intermittent water bodies support biota with drought resistance or avoidance traits and few macroinvertebrates or amphibians. Permanently inundated systems provide habitat for mobile species such as waterbirds.
 
# Key Ecological Drivers
 
These water bodies are constructed for agriculture, mining, ornamentation or wastewater by earthworks that obstruct surface flow, groundwater seepage or headwater channels. Humans may regulate inputs of water, nutrients and chemicals, as well as water drawdown. Droughts and storms contribute to resource variability. Shallow depth and typically flat terrain exposes open water to rapid solar heating, and hence diurnally warm temperatures. Substrates are typically mud or gravel, but cobbles and debris of varied sizes may be added and organic material may accumulate over time, increasing habitat complexity. Nutrient levels are highest in wastewater or with runoff from fertilised agricultural land or urban surfaces. Some water sources (e.g. mines, industrial wastewater) have concentrated chemical toxins or high salinities. Humans may actively introduce and remove biota of various trophic levels (e.g. bacteria, algae, fish, macrophytes) for water quality management.
 
# Distribution
 
Scattered across most regions of the world occupied by humans. Farm dams covered an estimated 77,000km2 globally in 2006.
