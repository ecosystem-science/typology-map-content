# Development of the typology

## Realms

The five realms represent (first level) form the environments of the world. We developed a way of capturing the major drivers of ecosystems which shape their characteristics across these realms. This allowed us to more finely divide these realms into biomes (second level) first and then ecosystem functional groups (third level) within each realm.

## Biomes

We focused on the ecosystem functions and traits that shape each one of the biomes. For example, deserts of the world have very low rainfall and extreme temperatures, restricting plant productivity.  This version (v1.0) of the **IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology** recognises 25 biomes, predominantly covering freshwater, marine, terrestrial and subterranean realms. These also include ecosystems largely developed by human societies, albeit modifying natural ecosystems, such as crops, cities and dams.

## Ecosystem Functional Groups

We formed groups of specialist scientists from around the world to develop the ecosystem functional groups (third level) under the biomes. This group used their expertise and scientific publications during this development phase. In this process, we also built on available regional, national and other broad classifications previously done. They identified gradients of drivers (e.g. moisture, salinity, depth) which filtered the different ecosystems into different types.

In terrestrial environments, important gradients included water, seasonality, temperature, nutrients, fire and herbivory. In subterranean environments, the type of floor or bottom of the ecosystem was important. In freshwater environments, flow regimes (duration, timing, volume, velocity), water body size, seasonal freezing and salinity were included. In marine environments, changes in light and nutrients with depth and area, the type of floor or bottom and its stability were important.

For each ecosystem functional group, we simplified its key drivers and characteristics or traits in a diagram.

## Indicative maps

Finally, we put together ‘indicative’ maps from available data for the ecosystems. The availability of these data varied enormously from those that were well developed to broad ecoregions, which included types of ecosystems.  We expect these maps to be continually improved, along with the typology (indicated by the version number).
